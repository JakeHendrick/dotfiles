Fork this repo and clone it in your home directory so that you get `~/dotfiles`. The included `.gitconfig` includes my name and email, so you'll want to change those to your own.

To set everything up:

``` shell
sh setup.sh
```

**Note**: On Windows, you must run the setup script using [Git Bash for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io) or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) (WSL).
